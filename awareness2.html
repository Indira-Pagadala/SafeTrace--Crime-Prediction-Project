        <div class="law-text">
          <p>Crime laws are established to maintain order in society and protect individuals from unlawful acts. These laws encompass various sections and regulations aimed at preventing, investigating, and punishing criminal activities.</p>
          <p>Crime laws, also known as criminal laws or penal laws, are regulations that define behaviors that are considered harmful or detrimental to society. These laws set out the parameters for what constitutes a crime, the punishments for committing a crime, and the legal procedures for investigating, prosecuting, and punishing individuals accused of violating these laws.</p>
          <p>Understanding crime laws is crucial for both citizens and legal professionals to ensure compliance and to protect individuals' rights within a society. These laws serve to maintain order, safeguard the public, and provide a framework for justice and fairness in addressing criminal behavior.</p>

      <h2>Basic Laws and Sections</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Here are some fundamental laws and sections that protect victims:</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
          <h3><strong>Law A: Right to equality</strong></h3>
          <br>
          <div class="law-container">
            <div class="law-text">
              <p>The Indian Constitution's Right to Equality (Article 14) guarantees equality before the law within Indian territory. Anyone and everyone who is on Indian soil, including corporations and foreigners as well as citizens of India, is subject to this law.

                Classification is allowed under Article 14 as long as it is "reasonable," but class legislation is not allowed. It is appropriate to classify people into groups when:</p>
                <br>
                <li>The classification is based on discernible differences that separate the grouped individuals or things from those who are not included in the group.</li>
                <br>
                <li>he disparity makes sense in connection to the act's goal.</li>
              </div>

        <br>
        <div class="law-container">
          <div class="law-text">
            <p>The Fundamental Rights in India enshrined in part III (Article 12â€“35) of the Constitution of India guarantee civil liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace and harmony as citizens of India.[1] These rights are known as "fundamental" as they are the most essential for all-round development i.e., material, intellectual, moral and spiritual and protected by fundamental law of the land i.e. constitution. If the rights provided by Constitution especially the Fundamental rights are violated the Supreme Court and the High Courts can issue writs under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, respectively, directing the State Machinery for enforcement of the fundamental rights.</p>

        <br>
        <div class="law-container">
          <div class="law-text">
            <p>The male police officer cannot arrest a female criminal between 6 pm to 6 am. They will require only a female police officer to arrest them if they have to arrest them.
              But after 6 am till 5 pm in the evening, if the male officer has to arrest any female criminal, then he can do so because, in this time slot, the male officer has the power to arrest any female criminal.
              Women cannot be arrested between 6 Pm to 6 Am. This law comes under Section 46(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
              Section 46 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides for the arrest mode. 
              Section 46 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 states that no woman shall be arrested after sunset and before sunrise by any male police officer.</p>

        <br>
        <div class="law-container">
          <div class="law-text">
            <p>On August 4, 2009, the Indian Parliament passed the Right to Education Act (RTE). In accordance with Article 21(a) of the Indian Constitution, this law outlines the specifics of the importance of free and compulsory education for children aged 6 to 14 in India.

              Every child between the ages of 6 and 14 has the fundamental right to access an education, and RTE establishes minimum standards for primary institutions.
              
              According to this rule, all private schools must reserve 25 percent of their seats for students (to be reimbursed by the state as part of the public-private partnership plan).
              
              Additionally, it forbids any unrecognised schools from operating, and it stipulates that there will be no donation or capitation fees, as well as no parent or child interviews for admittance.
              
              The Act also states that until the end of elementary school, no kid shall be held back, expelled, or compelled to pass a board exam.
              
              Additionally, there is a facility for additional instruction for drop outs to bring them up to level with pupils their own age.</p>

              As per the citizen charter (Indian Oil Corporation website)
              Few individuals are aware that the gas company is responsible for compensating the victim with Rs. 50 lakh if their gas cylinder explodes while they are cooking food. Customers must file a FIR at the closest police station and submit it to the relevant gas agency in order to be eligible for this compensation.</p>

          <div class="law-text">
            According to Article 21, no one, not even the government, has the right to take your life. Under passing laws to protect you, the government is required by this law to take the necessary steps to protect life. 

In addition, the right to life requires the government to protect you if your life is in danger by taking the necessary measures.

When making decisions that could put you in risk or have an impact on your life expectancy, public authorities should also take into account your right to life.

You can be entitled to an investigation if a family member passes away due to state involvement.

The majority of Indians are aware of some of our fundamental legal rights, but there are a few that you may not be aware of.

        <br>
        <div class="law-container">
          <div class="law-text">
            <p>The first and one of the main laws that every Indian should know is that police are never off duty., and this statement comes under the Police Act of 1861.

              The Police Act of 1861 is an act regulating Police. Police - officers are always on duty and may be employed in any part of the district. 
              
              This law means that a police officer is never off duty, whether wearing the police uniform or normal clothes. Once a policeman is always a policeman. 
              The policeman has all the power while he is in his uniform or his home clothes.
              The entire police - establishment under a State Government shall, for this Act, be deemed to be one police - force and shall be formally enrolled; and shall consist of such number of officers and men, and shall be constituted in such manner, as shall from time to time be ordered by the State Government. 
              The superintendence of the police throughout the general police - district shall vest in and shall be exercised by the State Government to which such district is subordinate, and except as authorized under the provisions of this Act, no person or officer of the Court shall be empowered by the State Government to supersede or control any police functionary. 
              The Inspector-General of Police shall have the full powers of a Magistrate throughout the general police - district but shall exercise those powers subject to such limitation as may, from time to time, be imposed by the State Government. </p>

        <h3><strong>Law L:Right to constitutional remedies</strong></h3>
        <br>
        <div class="law-container">
          <div class="law-text">
            <p>The Constitution guarantees remedies if citizensâ€™ fundamental rights are violated. The government cannot infringe upon or curb anyoneâ€™s rights. When these rights are violated, the aggrieved party can approach the courts. Citizens can even go directly to the Supreme Court which can issue writs for enforcing fundamental rights.</p>

              The police officer in these situations "will be responsible for prosecution and punishment," according to the Supreme Court. How should I use this right?
              
              Visit the police station (preferably close to the crime scene) and provide the officer in charge of that area all the information you have. Additionally, Section 154 of the CrPC offers the informant the option of providing information verbally or in writing.</p>
